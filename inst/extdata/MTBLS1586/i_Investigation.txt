Study Protocol Description	"<p>The wildtype N2 Bristol and the <em>hlh-30</em> mutant (tm1978, a kind gift from Dr. Marlene Hansen, Sandford-Burnham Medical Research Institute) were used and cultivated under standard conditions and handled as described (Harvald et al., 2017). Worms were synchronized and grown until L4 stage on NGM seeded plates. For RNAi treatment worms were transferred to plates containing IPTG seeded with the respective HT115 RNAi bacteria clone. At L4, worms were transferred to empty plates to induce starvation conditions. Worms were harvested at specified time points by washing off plates with MS-grade H2O and washed thrice. After the final wash, worms were incubated under rotation at RT for 20 min in H2O. Samples were spun down for 1 min at 1,100 rpm / RT and supernatant aspirated. Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80˚C.</p>"	"<p>Samples were extracted by using the BUME method as described (Lofgren et al., 2012) with minor modifications. Briefly, 50 μL ice-cold methanol was added to each sample and transferred to beatbeating tubes (NucleoSpin Bead Tubes Type A, Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany). The samples were beat-beaten for three times 10 seconds with 20 seconds pause in a Precellys Beat Beating system (Bertin Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). The additional Cryolys module was used with liquid nitrogen to prevent excessive heating of samples during disruption. 150 μL butanol and 200 μL heptane-ethyl acetate (3:1) was added to each sample sequentially which were then incubated for 1 h at 500 rpm / RT. 200 μL 1% acetic acid was added to each sample followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 13000 rpm / 4˚C. The upper organic phase was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube and the lower aqueous phase was re-extracted by the addition of 200 μL heptane-ethyl acetate followed by incubation and centrifugation as described above. The upper organic phase was transferred to the already obtained organic phase. The lower phase was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and used for metabolomic analyses. Samples were evaporated to dryness and stored at -20˚C.</p><p>For lipidomics, samples were re-dissolved in 50 μL 65% isopropanol/ 35% acetonitrile/ 5 % H2O, vortexed and 40 μL were transferred to an autosampler vial. The remaining 10 μL were pooled to form a QC sample for the entire study. The precipitated proteins were used for determination of protein content using a Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany).</p><p>For metabolomics, samples were re-dissolved in 30 μL 1% formic acid, spun down for 5 min at 16000g / RT and 25 μL were transferred to HPLC vials. The remaining 5 μL were pooled to form a QC sample for the entire study.</p>"	"<p>Lipids were analyzed as previously described (Witting et al., 2014). Briefly, lipids were separated on a Waters Acquity UPLC (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) using a Waters Cortecs C18 column (150 mm x 2.1 mm ID, 1.6 μm particle size, Waters, Eschborn Germany) and a linear gradient from 68% eluent A (40% H2O / 60% acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid) to 97% eluent B (10% acetonitrile / 90% isopropanol, 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid).</p>"	"<p>Mass spectrometric detection was performed using a Bruker maXis UHR-ToF-MS (Bruker Daltonic, Bermen, Germany) in positive and negative ionization mode using data dependent acquisition to obtain MS1 and MS2 information. For every ten samples a pooled QC was injected to check performance of the UPLC-UHR-ToF-MS system and were used for normalization.</p>"	"<p>Raw data was processed with Genedata Expressionist for MS 12.0 (Genedata AG, Basel, Switzerland). Preprocessing steps included noise subtraction, m/z recalibration, chromatographic alignment and peak detection and grouping. Data was exported for Genedata Expressionist for MS 12.0 Analyst statistical analysis software and as .xlxs for further investigation. Maximum peak intensities were used for statistical analysis and data was normalized on the protein content of the sample and an intensity drift normalization based on QC samples was used to normalize for the acquisition sequence.</p>"	"<p>Lipids were putatively annotated on the MS1 level using an in-house developed database for C. elegans lipids and bulk composition from LipidMaps (O'Donnell, Dennis, Wakelam, &amp; Subramaniam, 2019), when available. MS2 data was extracted using Bruker Data Analysis 5.0 (Bruker Daltonics) and read into R using the MSnbase package (Gatto &amp; Lilley, 2012). Matching against an in-silico database of C. elegans lipids and LipidBlast was performed using the masstrixR package (Kind et al., 2013) (Witting unpublished, https://github.com/michaelwitting/masstrixR) and only hits with a forward and reverse matching score &gt; 0.75 were considered. Lipids with a p-value &lt; 0.05 and a foldchange of &gt; 2 or &lt; 0.5 were considered to be significantly changed. Annotations of interesting biological peaks were manually verified and corrected if necessary.</p>"
